        <p>
          Perceptron is a web app that simplifies the studying process. You simply upload a picture of your notes and it
          will generate multiple-choice quiz questions based on these notes. You can also upload screenshots or plain
          text. After the quiz has been generated, you can immediately play it. Alternatively, you can preview the
          questions (answers are hidden) or edit the questions before you play. The app also has an explore tab, where
          you can see quizzes other people have made; and a library tab, where you can see all of your quizzes.

        <p>This app is potentially transformative to studentsâ€™ study habits:</p>

            <p>By adding confetti animations and instant right or wrong feedback, students are always engaged.</p>

            <p>
              Nowadays, AI is often criticized for being used to cheat. Perceptron tries to undermine that criticism by
              helping students to study.
