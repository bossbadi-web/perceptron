        <p>
          Throughout this document, "we", "us", and "our" refer to the creators of this website. "You" refers to the
          user of this website. "Perceptron" refers to a quiz that you create on this website.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>When you sign up for an account, we collect your email address and the password that you choose.</p>

        <p>When you create a Perceptron, we collect the title, description, and background image URL that you enter.</p>

        <p>
          You also have the option to upload an image of your notes. The image is processed by a <a
            class="hover-underline"
            href="https://ocr.space/ocrapi">third-party service</a
          >
          that extracts the text from the image. We use the extracted text and/or the additional notes that you enter to
          generate quiz questions using another
          <a class="hover-underline" href="https://api.gopubby.com/chatbot">third-party service</a>. Finally, we store
          the generated quiz questions in our database.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>
          We use your email address to send you a verification email when you register for an account. We use your email
          address to send you a password reset email when you request a password reset. We do not use your email address
          for any other purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          We store your email address and password in our Supabase database. The password is stored as a hash, which
          means that we cannot see your password. We do not store your password in plain text. We do not store your
          email address or password anywhere else.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
